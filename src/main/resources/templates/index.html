        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Matthew Ifould I am a Software Engineering graduate from the <a
                href="https://www.brighton.ac.uk/">University of Brighton</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been working in sales and supervisory roles since I left university but I recently decided to leave
            my
            job this June to re-educate myself in software engineering with a goal of getting a position as an
            application developer. Since then I have spent typical working hours studying new technologies
            using online learning as well as updating my existing experience in programming languages I was already
            familiar with. I have completed several online courses and certifications during this time.
            I have also been developing hobby projects using this acquired knowledge, which are available to view on the
            <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> section of this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have taken a particular interest in mobile and web related development and decided to learn the Flutter
            framework and Dart language to
            simultaneously develop native applications in both IOS and Android. I have used various libraries and APIs
            to develop
            several applications giving me a good knowledge of reactive development as well as tools and resources. I am
            however still interested in developing my knowledge of platform specific development which I am currently
            working on.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my aims while educating myself was to get a broader understanding of fundamentals, architectures and
            design patterns which is why I decided to learn the Spring Framework, this gave me knowledge of many new (to
            me at least) concepts, such as Inversion of Control, MVC, ORM, RESTful services.
